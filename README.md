# Huddle Website (Frontend Mentor)

This is my personal solution to the [Huddle website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100).

## Overview

### The challenge

The users should be able to:

    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
